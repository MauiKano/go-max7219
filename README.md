## Foreword

This project is mainly a fork of respective functionality originally written by Richard Hull in python: <https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219>. Newetheless it differs in some parts: refuse some functionality (works only with matrix led), include extra functionality (extra fonts, support of national languages).

## MAX7219 driver

This library intended to output text messages to 8x8 LED matrix display (pdf reference) via MAX7219 driver chip (pdf reference):

This lib intended to work not only with Raspberry PI, but with counterparts as well (tested with Raspberry PI and Banana PI). It may works with any Raspberry PI clone, which support Kernel SPI bus, and you should carry out all necessary preparations to make SPI bus device present in /dev/ list.

## Golang usage

```go
func main() {
	// Create new LED matrix with number of cascaded devices is equal to 1.
	mtx := max7219.NewMatrix(1)
	// Open SPI device with spibus and spidev parameters equal to 0 and 0.
	// Set LED matrix brightness is equal to 7.
	err := mtx.Open(0, 0, 7)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer mtx.Close()
	// Output text message to LED matrix.
	mtx.SlideMessage("Hello world!!! Hey Beavis, let's rock!",
		max7219.FontCP437, true, 50*time.Millisecond)
}
```

## Dependencies

Import and use package [github.com/fulr/spidev](http://github.com/fulr/spidev) to interact with max7219 chip via Linux SPI device.

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/d2r2/go-max7219/max7219
```

## Quick Start

To output a single letter to LED matrix by specifing ascii code use OutputAsciiCode call:
```go
	// Output a sequence of ascii codes in a loop
	font = max7219.FontCP437
	for i := 0; i <= len(font.GetLetterPatterns()); i++ {
		mtx.OutputAsciiCode(0, font, i, true)
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	}
```
To output a single national letter either unicode letter (rune) to LED matrix use OutputChar call:
```go
	// Output non-latin national letter (russian for example).
	// You must be sure, that your national letter should match code page of font used.
	mtx.OutputChar(0, max7219.FontZXSpectrumRus, 'Ð¯', true)
```
